<p>The erlocator application was written for presentation at Erlang Factory San Francisco 2013.</p>

<p>It can be used to expose nearby users browsing the same web site at the same time, but it was
written primarily as a reference application to demonstrate the use of erlang to build a 
practical feature.</p>

<p>The architecture of the application is very simple. Erlang is used to handle http requests 
and manage internal processes that take actions based on the request. Heavier processing is 
done with  Natively Implemented Functions in C, and data is stored in Redis.</p>

<p>We used Mochiweb to build the webserving capability, we used Redo for handling Redis, and we 
implemented a numeric version of the GeoHash algorythm for aggregating geographic points in 
regions within Redis to facilitate quick, easy retrieval of entries within close proximity 
to one another.</p>

<p>The numeric implementation of GeoHash pads a single large integer with 1 in the most 
significant bit position and then adds bits of latitude and longitude until the desired 
precision has been expressed.</p>

<p>To avoid edge cases where the requested point is in an extremity of its region, we return a 
grid of regions around a central region. This ensures that neighbors in all directions can 
be found.</p>

<p>The initial implementation returned a 3 x 3 grid of regions around the region requested, and 
subsequent improvements will involve returning an arbitrarily sized grid of regions.</p>

<p>It is important to note that this application was put together very quickly to demonstrate 
the concepts. There has been no attention to security issues, and it should not be deployed 
in such a fashion that it is directly accessible by clients. </p>
